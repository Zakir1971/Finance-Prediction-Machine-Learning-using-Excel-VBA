Predicting bankruptcy using Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to predict whether a firm is going to go bankrupt based on its
financial ratios. The prediction will be made using a machine learning (ML) technique known
as stochastic gradient descent (hereafter SGD) Using pure Excel VBA.
We are provided with two datasets: a train dataset and a test dataset. The two datasets have
the same structure.
